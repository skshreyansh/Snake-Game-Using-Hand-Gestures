# Snake-Game-Using-Hand-Gestures
This game is designed with basic OOPs and machine learning models to move the snake using certain hand gestures.

The game basically requires a camera to look for the gestures and responds with the result on the snakes movement.
The training images for this model has been generated from my hand movements and has been trained on teachable machine.

The game can be played on a localhost using game.html file where one can make movements on hands to see the snakes movements and get familiarised with the structure of the game.

One can also play the basic snake game using just by changing the script"snake_using_HG.js" to "basicsnake.js" and play the game using keyboard arrows.

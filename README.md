# Snake-Game-Using-Hand-Gestures
This game is designed with basic OOPs and machine learning models to move the snake using certain hand gestures.

The game basically requires a camera to look for the gestures and responds with the result on the snakes movement.
The training images for this model has been generated from my hand movements and has been trained on teachable machine.
